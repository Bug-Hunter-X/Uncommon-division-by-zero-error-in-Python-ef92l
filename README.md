This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario related to division by zero in Python.  The `bug.py` file contains a function that handles typical cases of division by zero correctly, but fails to explicitly address the scenario when both inputs are zero, which leads to a subtle error. The `bugSolution.py` provides a solution by adding an explicit check for this uncommon case.
